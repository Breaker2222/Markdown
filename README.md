<h1>Repair instructions</h1>

<h3>1. Locate the starter</h3>

<ul>
<li>Identify the driver right hand side of the engine block</li>
<li>Look for a cylindrical device attached to the lower part of the block </li>
<li>It will have a large gauge "red" wire attached to the top</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Removing the starter</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don safety gear</li>
<li>Make sure that the battery is <strong><em>disconnected</em></strong></li>
<li>Unscrew the nuts holding the wires to the starter solenoid with the 5/8 socket and ratchet<strong><em>tape and label each wire prior to disconnecting</em></strong></li>
<li>Disconnect the wires</li>
<li><strong><em>Human 1</em></strong> shall hold the starter while <strong><em>Human 2</em></strong> completes the next steps</li>
<li>Use the 9/16 socket and wrench to unscrew the 3 bolts holding the starter to the block</li>
<li>Take the weight of the starter from <strong><em>Human 1</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Human 2</em></strong> hand off the starter to <strong><em>Human 1</em></strong> </li>
<li><strong><em>Human 2</em></strong> pull the starter toward the front of the machine and then down to extract it <strong><em>BE CAREFUL IT'S HEAVY</em></strong></li>
<li>On the off hand chance that the starter was spinning, but the engine was not turning, take a flashlight and look in to the mounting hole where the starter to check for missing gear teeth </li>
<li>If missing teeth are found on the crank gear then follow the steps below to verify your starter work and replace the broken gear inside the tractor</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Bench testing setup</h3>

<ul>
<li>Place starter on top of a non-conducting surface such as wood</li>
<li>Place the spare car battery on the bench as well</li>
<li>Attach the <strong><em>red</em></strong> and <strong><em>black</em></strong> jumper clamps to the battery while ensuring that the opposite ends do not touch</li>
<li>Attach the free black jumper clamp to the the front housing of the starter <strong><em>NOT TO THE GEAR INSIDE THE BELL HOUSING</em></strong></li>
<li>Attach the free red jumper clamp to the large copper lug on the starter solenoid, farthest from the starter "not the one with a shunt attached to it"</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Bench testing</h3>

<ul>
<li>Bridge the connection between the lug with the red jump cable and the smaller lug labeled <strong><em>s</em></strong> with the flat head screw driver.  <strong><em>This should activate the starter</em></strong></li>
<li>Note if the starter motor turned on or not</li>
<li>Note if the pinion in the bell housing fired out of its rest position</li>
<li>If the starter motor did not turn over, but the spur gear extended, then your starter motor needs to be repaired or replaced <strong><em>Step 5</em></strong></li>
<li>If the pinion in the bell housing did not extend then you need to repair or replace the starter solenoid <strong><em>Step 6</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Repairing the starter motor</h3>

<ul>
<li>Take a rubber mallet and hit the casing of the starter motor several times then repeat step 4</li>
<li>If nothing changes then replace the brushes and repeat step 4</li>
<li>If nothing changes then conduct a field continuity test after removing the armature.  Most likely you will need to replace the starter motor</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Repairing the starter solenoid</h3>

<ul>
<li>Remove the starter solenoid using your 5/16 socket on the two mounting bolts that attach it to the front of the starter motor</li>
<li>Remove the bolt attaching the starter solenoid to the shunt at the rear of the starter motor</li>
<li>Rotate the starter solenoid so that the lip emerges from the front of the mount and then pull it out slowly</li>
<li>Remove the starter solenoid cap bolts(2) with the 1/4 socket and carefully pull it off</li>
<li>Note any obvious signs of damage such as melted wires or severed connections</li>
<li>If connections can be repaired then do so, otherwise replace the starter solenoid (part number S100 at advance auto parts)</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Reassembly</h3>

<ul>
<li>Replace the broken components and reassemble the starter</li>
<li>Test the starter in accordance with step 4</li>
<li>If no further discrepancies are found then move on to step 8</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Mounting</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Human 1</em></strong> insert the starter into the block from below the tractor so that the 3 bolts line up with their respective holes and hold it in place</li>
<li><strong><em>Human 2</em></strong> hand thread the bolts into their respective holes and do not cross thread</li>
<li>Use the 9/16 socket and or wrench to tighten the bolts <strong><em>DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Human 1</em></strong> can then let go of the starter</li>
<li>Attach the labeled wires to their locations <strong><em>DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN THE NUTS</em></strong></li>
<li>Connect batter leads and conduct a normal start of the tractor </li>
<li>If the tractor does not start, repeat repair procedures or take the tractor to an authorized mechanic</li>
</ul>
